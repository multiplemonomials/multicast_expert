## [1.5.0] - 2025-02-07

This release is focused on addressing the performance issues caused by multicast_expert rescanning the network interfaces on the machine each time a socket is opened. You can now avoid this overhead by using the new scan functions and then passing their result into the socket constructors' `iface` argument.

### Added
- `multicast_expert.scan_interfaces()` provides a more complete wrapper around `netifaces` It will scan all the interface details from the machine into a list of `IfaceInfo` dataclass objects.
- `multicast_expert.find_interfaces()` provides an easy way to locate interfaces matching a given specifier. The specifier may be an IPv4 or IPv6 address of the interface (as a string or an object), or an interface name (e.g. eth0).

### Changed
- `McastTxSocket` and `McastRxSocket` now accept an `IfaceSpecifier` for their interface IP arguments instead of just an IP address string. This is compatible with old usage but allows a wider range of values to be used, including an interface obtained from `scan_interfaces()` or `find_interfaces()`.
- `McastTxSocket` and `McastRxSocket` now accept IPv4Address and IPv6Address objects in addition to strings for the `mcast_ips` and `source_ips` constructor arguments.
  - Note that the sendto() and recvfrom() functions still accept and return only string addresses, as this matches the behavior of the `socket` module (surprisingly).

### Fixed
- It is now possible to unambiguously open a socket on an interface that has the same IP as another interface (in most cases). Previously, it was undefined which interface you'd get if this happened.
- It is now possible to open a `McastRxSocket` socket on a machine with interfaces with multiple IPs. This previously crashed unless you explicitly specified one interface to use.

## [1.4.2] - 2025-01-31

### Fixed
- Fix mypy and pylance "name not exported" error visible for users of the library

_______________________________________________________________________________

## [1.4.1] - 2025-01-30

### Added
- Linting (via ruff, pyright, and docsig in addition to the preexisting mypy) and autoformatting (via ruff) has been added to the project
- New release workflow via Trusted Publishing
- Add FAQ entry about IGMP Querier mode in README

_______________________________________________________________________________

## [1.4.0] - 2023-12-21

### Added
- multicast_expert now has Github Actions CI thanks to Victor Tang's contribution! It is now automatically tested on Mac, Linux, and Windows.
- Add `enable_external_loopback` option on tx and rx sockets, which can be used to turn on multicast loopback for non-loopback interfaces. Note that this option has to be set on both the Tx and Rx sockets in order to work correctly on all platforms.

### Fixed
- Fix bug which prevented opening IPv6 multicast Tx sockets on Linux in some situations.
- Fix mypy type checker error on non-Windows platforms due to use of ctypes Windows functionality.

_______________________________________________________________________________

## [1.3.0] - 2023-10-20

### Fixed
- Fix the type annotation for McastRxSocket.settimeout() parameter.

### Changed
- Replace `blocking` arg to McastRxSocket with `timeout`, which allows you to set an integer timeout in the constructor. The old argument is still supported but is marked as legacy.

## [1.2.2] - 2023-06-30

### Fixed
- Fix some mypy errors that were visible for users of the library.

_______________________________________________________________________________

## [1.2.1] - 2023-06-29

### Fixed
- Fix IPv6 McastRxSocket being broken on Linux when multiple interfaces were used (need to open an OS socket for each interface ip-mcast ip permutation)

_______________________________________________________________________________

## [1.2.0] - 2023-06-29

### Added
- An McastRxSocket can now listen on multiple interface IPs at once via passing a list of interface addresses to the new `iface_ips` parameter.  The old `iface_ip` parameter is retained for compatibility. 
- If no interface IPs are specified, McastRxSocket now listens on all non-loopback interfaces instead of just the default gateway.  This should provide more intuitive default behavior for applications where the interface for receiving isn't known.
- Type annotations now applied to everything, library passes mypy in strict mode. 
- py.typed file now provided so that mypy can see type annotations provided by multicast_expert in your own projects.
